  <abstract>
    <t>This document defines requirements for IPv6 CE Routers to support DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation 
    for redistributing any unused prefix(es) that were delegated to the IPv6 CE Router.  
    This document updates RFC 7084.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
    <t>This document defines DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in IPv6 CE Routers (<xref target="RFC7084" />) 
    in order to properly utilize the IPv6 prefixes assigned by service providers.  Many ISP will assign 
    a prefix larger then /64 to the CE Router as recommended in <xref target="RFC6177" />. If a IPv6 CE 
    Router doesn't support IA_PD on the LAN it will not be able to assign any prefixes beyond itself limiting
    the usefulness of assigning prefixes larger then /64.  Supporting IA_PD on the LAN interfaces will allow
    for those prefixes to be distributed into a network to be useable.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
      "SHALL&nbsp;NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD&nbsp;NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
      "NOT&nbsp;RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
      are to be interpreted as described in BCP&nbsp;14
      <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when,
      and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document also makes use of internal conceptual variables to
      describe protocol behavior and external variables that an implementation
      must allow system administrators to change. The specific variable names,
      how their values change, and how their settings influence protocol
      behavior are provided to demonstrate protocol behavior. An
      implementation is not required to have them in the exact form described
      here, as long as its external behavior is consistent with that described
      in this document.</t>

    <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
    <t>The following terminology is defined for this document.
    <list style="symbols">
        <t>IPv6 CE Router: A router intended for home or small-office use that forwards packets explicitly
        addressed to itself as defined in <xref target='RFC7084'/>.</t>
        <t>Internet Service Provider (ISP): An entity that provides access to the Internet.  
        In this document, a service provider specifically offers Internet access using IPv6, and 
        may also offer IPv4 Internet access.  The service provider can provide such access over a 
        variety of different transport methods such as DSL, cable, wireless, and others.</t>

    <t> The IPv6 CE Router distributes configuration information obtained during WAN interface
    provisioning to IPv6 hosts and routers.  A router based on <xref target="RFC7084"/> previously 
    would only address IPv6 hosts, this update to allow for addressing and routing of routers.</t>

    <t>LAN Prefix Delegation (PD) Requirements</t>
        <t>LPD-1: The IPv6 CE Router MUST support DHCPv6 server capable of IPv6 prefix assignment 
        according to <xref target="RFC8415"/> (Idenity Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) option).</t>
        <t>LPD-2: The IPv6 CE Router MUST assign addresses from the delegated prefix to the number of interfaces. 
        If not enough addresses are available the IPv6 CE Router SHOULD log a system management error.</t>
        <t>LPD-3: After interface address assignment the IPv6 CE Router MUST make the remaining IPv6 prefixes
        available to other Routers via Prefix Delegation</t>
        <t>LPD-4: The IPv6 CE Router MUST give out a IA_PD of the remaining prefixes with a IA_PD size of 64.</t>
        <t>LPD-5: The IPv6 CE Router MUST install a route to the IA_PD assigned with a next-hop of the IPv6 node 
        assigned the address.</t>
        <t>LPD-6: If a IPv6 CE Router recieves IPv6 prefixes of size 64 it MUST enable delegating relay according 
        to <xref target="RFC8987"/>. The MUST forward all the DHCPv6 Relay messages to the 
        All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.</t>
