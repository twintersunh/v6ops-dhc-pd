      <t>This document defines requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) routers to 
    support DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation for distributing available prefixes that were 
    delegated to a IPv6 CE router.  This document updates RFC 7084.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document describes guidelines for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) 
    routers <xref target="RFC7084"/> in order to properly utilize the IPv6 prefixes delegated by 
    service providers. Many service providers assign larger address blocks than /64 to CE routers, 
    as recommended in <xref target="RFC6177"/>. If an IPv6 CE router does not support the 
    Identity Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) Prefix Option 
    (<xref target="RFC8415" section="21.21"/>) on the LAN, it will not be able to assign any prefixes beyond its local 
    interfaces, limiting the usefulness of assigning prefixes larger than /64 by the operator.  Supporting 
    IA_PD on the LAN interfaces of a CE router will allow those unused prefixes to be distributed 
    into a network.  Note that efforts such as those of the Stub Networking Auto Configuration 
    (SNAC) Working Group depend on IPv6 prefixes being properly distributed in the LAN.</t>
      <t>Two models, hierarchical prefix and flat, were proposed in the past for prefix sub-delegation beyond 
    an IPv6 CE router. 
    
    Hierarchical prefix delegation requires an IPv6 CE router to sub-delegate IPv6 prefixes 
    based on a set of rules. If more than one router uses hierarchical prefix delegation, an IPv6 prefix tree is created.  
    When no routing protocol is enabled to discover the network topology, it is possible to have an unbalanced 
    prefix delegation tree, which leads to running out of prefixes.  More information on hierarchical prefix 
    delegation can be found, e.g., in Section 8.5 of CableLabs IPv6 eRouter specification <xref target="eRouter"/>. 

    A flat prefix delegation requires the router to be provisioned with the initial prefix and to assign /64 prefixes 
    to all other prefix requests from routers in the LAN-facing interface. 
<!--[rfced] For clarity, how may this be rephrased? In particular,
the phrase "CE Router supporting prefix delegation" is unclear.

Original:
   The default configuration of CE Router supporting
   prefix delegation is designed to be a flat model to support zero
   configuration networking.

Perhaps:
   For prefix delegation that supports CE routers, the default 
   configuration is designed to be a flat model to support
   zero-configuration networking.

Or simply:
   For prefix delegation that supports CE routers, the default 
   configuration is a flat model to support zero-configuration 
   networking.

<!--[rfced] Please clarify "multi-provisioned networks". Is there 
another term that is more common? The term "multi-provisioned" 
does not appear in past RFCs or current Internet-Drafts.

Original:
   This document does not cover dealing with multi-provisioned networks
   with more than one provider.
